<p>Welcome to CBAW! We are the premier amateur fermentation club at UC Berkeley.
	</p>
<p>As a Registered Student Organization, we have access to University resources for general meetings.
	</p>
<p>Our signature events are our BREW CREWS: experienced brewers host a hands-on homebrewing event for a small group of club members. 
	The best way to learn is to do!
	</p>
<p>Additionally, we'll have:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Seminars on brewing basics, and the history and science behind food fermentation
		</li>
	<li>Invited speakers from industry and academia
		</li>
	<li>Field trips to local brewing operations*
		</li>
	<li>Beer and wine tasting events*
		</li>
	</ul>
<p>*not yet 21? We can't serve you alcohol, but don't despair: you can join a Brew Crew and attend other events!
